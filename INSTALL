** Building and installing HaskellDirect

1. Unpack the source distribution somewhere convenient
   and edit 'config.mk' at the top of the distribution.
   You'll need to supply the following:

     - HC -- the Haskell compiler to use [default: 'ghc']

2. Run 'make boot' from the toplevel HaskellDirect directory,
   followed by 'make'  (where 'make' == GNU make.)

3. Upon completion, run 'make lib' from the toplevel, which'll
   compile up the support libraries for both Hugs98 and GHC.
   
4. Assuming the last two steps completed successfully,
   that's it - you're now set to start using the IDL compiler.

   The examples/ directory contains, as you've probably guessed,
   some examples. See examples/README for overview of what the
   individual examples do.

   For the examples that work with both Hugs and GHC, you will
   need to invoke "make" as follows to build the Hugs version
   of the example

            make FOR_HUGS=YES

Extra goodies:
 
- to install the HDirect libraries (the generic and/or the COM
  specific ones) as GHC packages, you need to 'cd' into lib
  (and comlib/, if needs be), and 'make install-pkg'. This rule
  assumes that GHC_PKG refers to the ghc_pkg util that goes with
  the HC you configured in config.mk
  
  Upon successful completion, the generic HDirect libraries will
  be available as package 'hdirect', and the COM libraries as 'com'.

  The packages are useable from within GHCi and in batch-mode.

- to have HDirect support the reading (and writing) of COM type
  libraries, you need to 'make' src/ with SUPPORT_TYPELIBS=YES.
  This assumes that you already have a compiled up version of the
  HDirect COM library, which you clearly won't have initially.
  Hence, you need to either do a second clean build of the
  HDirect sources, or just make sure you re-make src/ after
  having built comlib/...here's how to do the latter:
  
    ...unpack sources and tailor config.mk ..
    foo$ make
    ..
    foo$ make lib
    foo$ cd comlib/
    foo$ make install-pkg GHC_PKG=/path/to/your/ghc/bin/ghc-pkg
    foo$ cd ../src
    foo$ rm -f *.o
    foo$ make depend SUPPORT_TYPELIBS=YES
    foo$ make SUPPORT_TYPELIBS=YES
